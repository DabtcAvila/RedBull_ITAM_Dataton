# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - DNS CRISIS RESOLUTION
## casamx.store DNS Issue - CRITICAL FOR DATATON DEMO

### üî¥ CURRENT STATUS: DNS NOT WORKING
**Impact:** casamx.store is completely inaccessible via domain name

### üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**The domain zone does not exist in Cloudflare Dashboard**

Despite:

- ‚úÖ Nameservers correctly changed to Cloudflare
- ‚úÖ Target server (198.41.200.63) is online and accessible

Content: 198.41.200.63  
Proxy: Enabled (Orange Cloud)

Record 2:
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: tunnel
Proxy: Enabled (Orange Cloud)
```
