# CLOUDFLARE ZONE SETUP - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## CRITICAL: The domain zone casamx.store DOES NOT EXIST in Cloudflare

### WHY THE DNS IS FAILING
1. Domain nameservers correctly point to Cloudflare (liv.ns.cloudflare.com, sid.ns.cloudflare.com)
2. BUT Cloudflare doesn't have the zone configured
3. Result: Cloudflare nameservers return NXDOMAIN

### IMMEDIATE STEPS TO FIX

#### 1. Add Domain to Cloudflare (URGENT)
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click "Add a Site"
3. Enter: `casamx.store`
4. Select Free plan
5. Click "Add Site"

#### 2. Configure DNS Records
Once the zone is added, configure these records:

```
Type: A
Name: @ (root domain)
Content: 198.41.200.63
Proxy Status: Proxied (Orange Cloud)
TTL: Auto

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Content: tunnel
Proxy Status: Proxied (Orange Cloud) 
TTL: Auto
```

#### 3. Verify Tunnel Configuration
Ensure your Cloudflare Tunnel includes casamx.store in its hostname configuration.

### EXPECTED TIMELINE AFTER ZONE ADDITION
- Zone activation: Immediate
- DNS propagation: 5-10 minutes
- Full global propagation: 30 minutes maximum

### VERIFICATION COMMANDS
After adding the zone, run:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x /Users/davicho/MASTER\ proyectos/RedBull_ITAM_Dataton/dns_troubleshooting/*.sh

# Run immediate verification
./verify_dns_status.sh

# Run full diagnostic
./fix_dns_immediately.sh
```

### BACKUP SOLUTION
If Cloudflare setup takes too long, temporarily use:
1. Different domain that's already working
2. Direct IP access: http://198.41.200.63
3. ngrok or similar tunneling service

### FOR DATATON DEMO
If DNS isn't resolved in 15 minutes:
1. Use IP directly: http://198.41.200.63  
2. Set up local hosts file entry:
   ```bash
   echo "198.41.200.63 casamx.store" >> /etc/hosts
   ```

## STATUS CHECK
Run this command to check current status:
```bash
./verify_dns_status.sh
```

Expected result after fix:
- ✅ casamx.store resolves to 198.41.200.63
- ✅ www.casamx.store resolves via CNAME
- ✅ HTTP/HTTPS accessible
